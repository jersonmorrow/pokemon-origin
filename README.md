# Origin Tech Assessment

## Running Locally

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## Important Notes:

- You do not need to get through the entire assessment.
- You can use the internet and install whatever libraries you'd like.
- You can talk through implementation options and ask for help if you feel stuck at any point.

## Pre-installed libraries

- [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- [`ajv`](https://ajv.js.org/guide/getting-started.html)

## Styling

[`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) is installed and ready to use. However, if you'd prefer you can use vanilla CSS by authoring styles in [`src/index.css`](./src/index.css)

## End Goal & Getting Started

The main goal of this exercise is to work through some common programming problems that are faced when building applications for the web. Eventually we'd like to work with you to get to something that resembles this rough design. You can begin by opening up [`src/App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx) and reading the existing code and comments.
